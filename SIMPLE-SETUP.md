# Simple Setup: Just Tell Me Your FTP Details

## The Goal

You give me prompts → I build → Files automatically upload to your WordPress server

## What I Need (Just 4 Things)

1. **FTP Host**: `_________________`
   - Usually: `ftp.yourdomain.com` or `yourdomain.com` or an IP address

2. **FTP Username**: `_________________`
   - Your FTP login username

3. **FTP Password**: `_________________`
   - Your FTP login password

4. **FTP Port**: `21` or `22`
   - `21` = FTP (most common)
   - `22` = SFTP (more secure)

## Where to Find These

**Easiest way:**
1. Log into your **hosting account** (where you manage clarkesterraclean.co.uk)
2. Look for **"FTP"** or **"FTP Accounts"** or **"File Manager"**
3. The details are usually right there

**Or check your email:**
- Search for emails from your hosting provider
- They usually sent FTP details when you signed up

**Or call your hosting provider:**
- Ask: "What are my FTP credentials?"
- They'll tell you the 4 details above

## Once You Tell Me

I'll:
1. ✅ Configure the deployment script
2. ✅ Test the connection
3. ✅ Set up automatic uploads

Then every time you give me a prompt and I build something, it will:
- ✅ Commit to Git
- ✅ Push to GitHub
- ✅ Build CSS
- ✅ Upload to your WordPress server automatically!

## Example

Just say:
> "My FTP host is ftp.clarkesterraclean.co.uk, username is clarkesterraclean, password is mypassword123, port is 21"

And I'll handle the rest!
